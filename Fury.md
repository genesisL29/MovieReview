# MovieReview
The movie is very interesting to me because it is about war with the Americans and the Germans (nazi). Fury is the name of the tank in which there was only five people and all were very close. They made it so far and just with five people, they were able to kill a lot of Germans. Although four of them did die except for one because the leader, Don, told Machine to get out the tank from the hatch that was at the bottom of it. They were very brave, loyal to their leader, and pushed through without running away.
